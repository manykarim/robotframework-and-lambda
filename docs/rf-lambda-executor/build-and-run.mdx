# Build, Deploy and Run

### Prerequisites

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Build

You can build the Lambda Functions using the command 

```bash
sam build
```

It will create 

- a `.zip package` for the `distributor` and `merger` function
- a `Dockerimage` for the `executor` function

Check out the `Dockerfile` in the `executor/` folder and the `requirements.txt` file in the `distributor/` and `merger/` folder for more details about the **dependencies**.

### Deploy

To deploy your Lambda Function using CloudFormation, use the command:

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

It will run a wizard and ask for a final confirmation before deployment.  
CloudFormation will **keep track** of your already deployed resources and will only **re-deploy the changes**.


## Run

Before you can run the tests you need to **upload the test cases** to the S3 Bucket `Testsbucket`.

You can do this with the AWS Console or with the AWS CLI.

The Folder structure in the S3 Bucket `Testsbucket` shall look like that:

```bash
.
├── <project-name>
│   ├── tests
│   │   ├── <TestSuiteA>.robot
│   │   ├── <TestSuiteb>.robot
│   │   └── ...
│   └── resources
│       ├── <ResourceA>.resource
│       ├── <ResourceB>.resource
│       └── ...
└── <another-project>
    ├── tests
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
```

Multiple **Test Projects** (including `Test Suites` inside a `tests/` folder) can be stored on a single `Testsbucket`.

The `Distributor` and `Executor` will download only the required `project` folder (which is passed in the body of a **http post request**).


### Upload Test Cases

#### From AWS Console

Either open the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/) landing page and navigate to `S3`.  
Or open the [S3 Console](s3.console.aws.amazon.com) page directly.  

Select your `Testsbucket` from the list of S3 Buckets.  
You can either create the folders for your project manually or upload complete folders via the web page.

#### From AWS CLI
`aws` can copy singe files or complete folders recursively.  
To copy a folder `tests/` from your local filesystem to the S3 Bucket you can user the command below:

```bash
aws s3 cp --recursive tests/ s3://<testbucket-name>/<project>/tests
```

### Test Run from API Gateway Console


### A real run via an HTTP Endpoint

Before you can use the HTTP Endpoint, you need to set up an `API Key` and assign it to a `Usage Plan` and a `Stage`.

When triggering your Lambda Function via the HTTP Endpoint, you need to provide the `API Key` in the `Header` for authentication.

The reason is, that the API Endpoint will be available to the public and should require some authentication.  
Beside `API Keys` there are also other ways of authentication.  

#### Add API Key and Usage Plan via API Gateway Console

#### Run with curl

#### Run with Postman


## Cleanup

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name rf-lambda-executor
```
