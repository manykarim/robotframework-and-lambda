# Installation

## Install AWS CLI and SAM CLI

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) on your local machine.

Refer to the following links for more information:
[Getting started with SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started.html)

To complete the next steps, I assume that you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account
- Configured AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
- Configured AWS credentials on your local machine
- Docker installed and running on your local machine (to test locally and build your Lambda function's deployment package)
