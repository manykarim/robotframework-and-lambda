# Installation

## Install AWS CLI and SAM CLI

Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and [SAM CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html) on your local machine.

Refer to the following links for more information:
[Getting started with SAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-getting-started.html)

To complete the next steps, I assume that you have the following prerequisites:

- An AWS account
- Configured AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions
- Configured AWS credentials on your local machine
- Docker installed and running on your local machine (to test locally and build your Lambda function's deployment package)
- Homebrew installed on your local machine (macOS and Linux only)
- AWS SAM CLI installed on your local machine

## Deploy Hello World application

You can use the AWM SAM CLI to create, build, and deploy a simple Hello World application.

### Create a new application

Create a new application in a new directory.

```bash
sam init
```

The SAM CLI command above will prompt you with the following options:

```bash
Which template source would you like to use?
        1 - AWS Quick Start Templates
        2 - Custom Template Location
```
Choose 1 and press Enter.

```bash
Choose an AWS Quick Start application template
        1 - Hello World Example
        2 - Multi-step workflow
        3 - Serverless API
        4 - Scheduled task
        5 - Standalone function
        6 - Data processing
        7 - Infrastructure event management
        8 - Serverless Connector Hello World Example
        9 - Multi-step workflow with Connectors
        10 - Lambda EFS example
        11 - Machine Learning
``` 
Choose 1 and press Enter.

```bash
Use the most popular runtime and package type? (Python and zip) [y/N]: y

Would you like to enable X-Ray tracing on the function(s) in your application?  [y/N]: N

Project name [sam-app]: hello-lambda
```	

1. Enter `y` to select `Python` and `zip` as the most popular runtime and package type.  
2. Enter `N` to disable X-Ray tracing.  
3. Enter `hello-lambda` as the project name.

### Build and test the application

Build the application.

```bash
cd hello-lambda
sam build
```

### Deploy the application

Deploy the application.

```bash
sam deploy --guided
```

### Test the application

Test the application using the invoke command.

```bash
sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event events/event.json
```
