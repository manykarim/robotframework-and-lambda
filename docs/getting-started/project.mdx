# Robot Framework on AWS Lambda

I will explain the setup of a Robot Framework project on AWS Lambda using an existing project.  
It is parallel test execution project that splits up your test cases into multiple Lambda functions and executes them in parallel.

It will use multiple AWS Ressources:

- [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) to execute Robot Framework tests and use its API
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) to store the test cases and the test results
- [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) to store the run status
- [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) to communicate between the Lambda functions
- [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) to create the AWS Ressources

You can find the sample project [here](https://github.com/manykarim/rf-lambda-executor) and you can clone it with the command below:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manykarim/rf-lambda-executor
```

It will be featured at [RoboCon 2023](https://robocon.io/) in the my talk [To Infinity and Beyond - Serverless scaling with AWS Lambda](https://robocon.io/#to-infinity-and-beyond---serverless-scaling-with-aws-lambda).

## Project Structure

```bash	
.
├── distributor
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── Listener
│   │   ├── DistributorListener.py
│   │   └── __init__.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── executor
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── LICENSE
├── merger
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── poetry.lock
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── samconfig.toml
└── template.yaml
```

The most important parts are:

- the `distributor` , `executor` and `merger` folders which contain the Lambda functions
- the `template.yaml` file which contains the CloudFormation stack

## template.yaml

The `template.yaml` file is the main file for the CloudFormation stack. It contains all the AWS Ressources that will be created and the Lambda functions that will be deployed.  
It is a YAML file using the [SAM Specification](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-specification.html).
